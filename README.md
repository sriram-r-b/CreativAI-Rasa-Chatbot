# Rasa-Chatbot
A Simple chatbot based on Rasa framework<br />
You can Ask for a joke  or info about its creator.
This repo contains the server code for the chatbot . One can use a custom frontend or the ones that are available opensourced.

## Custom Model Creation
Clone the Repo. 
Create models directory in rasa-chatbot-docker directory. 
Train the Chatbot and deploy at heroku using docker(instructions available at youtube).  
Once online we can communicate through rest API or a frontend(few corrections to startservices.sh to be made).

## Usage without installation
My version of Chatbot is available @ http://creativai.herokuapp.com/webhooks/rest/webhook
execute communicate.py python file to chat with the chatbot
